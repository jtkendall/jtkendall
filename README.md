### Hi there, I'm Josh

I am a developer focused on building bespoke web and iOS solutions for clients of all sizes. I primarily build web projects in Laravel and WordPress while sticking to Swift for iOS projects.

ðŸŒ± I am currently building applications in Laravel with plans to start learning more about Kotlin and Rust. I dabble in C# when neccessary, prefer TypeScript over Javascript, and use Tailwind whenever possible.

ðŸ“« I can be found on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jtkendall) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtkendall/).
