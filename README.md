### Hi there I'm Josh

I'm a web developer who makes awesome and very manageable things. I spend a lot of time making sure clients get the exact solution they want. I also don't stick to web technologies, sometimes there are iOS projects, sometimes there's C#, and sometimes I find myself doing a ton of research on a specific service to determine if it will benefit my client.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on a Laravel and Vue.js CPQ product for a client.

ðŸŒ± I am currently focusing on learning as much as I can about TypeScript, Vue.js, and Svelte through actual client projects.

Other things I plan on learning more about are:

- [x] Svelte
- [ ] Marko
- [ ] Elm
- [ ] Blazor

ðŸ“« I can be found on twitter as @jtkendall. I am starting over on my account, but plan on focusing on only web development topics. You can send me a DM over there, but I do not have notifications on. I check twitter several times per day, so if you message or mention me Im not ignoring you, I most likely haven't seen it yet.
