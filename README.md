### Hi there, I'm Josh

I'm a developer who makes awesome and very manageable things. I spend a lot of time making sure clients get the exact solution they want, be it a WordPress plugin, iOS app, or a bespoke web application.

ðŸŒ± I am currently building applications in Laravel with plans to start learning more about Kotlin. I dabble in C# when neccessary, prefer TypeScript over Javascript, use SCSS over all other options when I have to write my own styles but prefer to use Tailwind whenever possible.

ðŸ“« I used to have a Twitter account, but I never use it. I don't like to post email addresses or other contact methods publically as it leads to spam and if I decide to change email address or a social media presence then I have to update this and hope people realize there's been a change. Instead of that I've created a repo called messages where anyone who needs to contact me can leave a short message under the discussions tab and I'll get back to them. [Read this](https://github.com/jtkendall/messages/discussions/1) **BEFORE** starting a discussion on that repo.
