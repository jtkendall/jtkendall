### Hi there, I'm Josh

I'm a developer who makes awesome and very manageable things. I spend a lot of time making sure clients get the exact solution they want, be it a WordPress plugin, iOS app, or a bespoke web application.

ðŸŒ± I am currently building applications in Laravel with plans to start learning more about Kotlin and Rust. I dabble in C# when neccessary, prefer TypeScript over Javascript, use Tailwind whenever possible.

ðŸ“« I can be found on Twitter and Instagram with this same username.
