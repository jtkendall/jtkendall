### Hi there I'm Josh

I am... well, I dont know what I actually am. I build websites for clients, but its not just "here is some HTML and CSS have a nice day". I spend a lot of time making sure clients get the exact solution they want. I also dont stick to web technologies, sometimes there are iOS projects, sometimes there's C#, and sometimes I find myself doing a ton of research on a specific service to determine if it will benefit my client. I guess lets just call me a software developer and we'll put an asterisk on the end.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working on predominently PHP (WordPress) projects but theres a lot of Vue.js and Microsoft Azure work involved as well.

ðŸŒ± I am currently focusing on learning as much as I can about TypeScript, Vue.js, and Svelte through actual client projects.

Other things I plan on learning more about are:

- [x] Svelte
- [ ] Marko
- [ ] Elm
- [ ] Blazor

ðŸ“« I can be found on twitter as @jtkendall. I am starting over on my account, but plan on focusing on only web development topics. You can send me a DM over there, but I do not have notifications on. I check twitter several times per day, so if you message or mention me Im not ignoring you, I most likely haven't seen it yet.
